        <blockquote>Cooking is a necessity for everyone. Everyone in their life time needs to learn how to cook because cooking makes food taste better. 
            Without cooking, everyone would eat raw fruits, vegetables etc. I am still learning how to cook but I consider it my hobby. At its most basic, 
            cooking means applying heat to food. Whether the food is baked, fried, sautéed, boiled, or grilled, it's all cooking. Evidence suggests our ancestors 
            began cooking over an open fire over 2 million years ago.
