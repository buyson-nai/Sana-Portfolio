                <h1><b>Bonifacio Global City</b></h1>
                <h2>Taguig, Metro Manila, Philippines</h2>
                <p>Bonifacio Global City (BGC) is located in Taguig, Metro Manila, Philippines.
                It's a thriving urban area known for its modern infrastructure, green spaces, and vibrant lifestyle. </p>
                <p>BGC's transformation began in the 1990s when the Philippine government decided to convert the former military base of Fort Bonifacio into a modern, business-centric district. 
                It was developed by the Fort Bonifacio Development Corporation (FBDC), a subsidiary of the Ayala Corporation</p>
                <p>BGC holds a special place in my heart because of its perfect blend of nature and modern living. I love walking around its wide, clean streets and discovering hidden gems like art parks, cafes, and boutiques. Itâ€™s a place where you can enjoy a peaceful, laid-back atmosphere during the day and experience an exciting nightlife in the evening. 
                The energy of the people, combined with the beautiful skyline and green spaces, makes it a memorable place for me.</p>
